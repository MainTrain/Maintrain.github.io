                    <p>I am pursing an Automotive Systems BSE at the ASU Polytechnic campus and a Business Minor through W.P. Carey School of Business. I have a passion for all things automotive, and I have specific interests in research and development,
                        manufacturing, and business strategy.
                        <br>
                        <br> Being at the Polytechnic campus has allowed me to pursue many hands-on projects that showed the challenges of bringing what seems like a perfect project to fruition. This has made me
                        able to quickly adapt to changes in order to make a close deadline, improve performance, and has broadened my perspective on engineering design.
                        <br>
                        <br> This website serves as a showcase for some of the projects that I have completed, helps keep me organized, and allows me to share some of my hobbies. I hope you enjoy your visit and maybe even learn something about what I’m
                        passionate for. Stay tuned for updates!

                    <p>I like to go hiking/backpacking and take cool pictures! I use a Fujifilm X-T20 and primarily use my Rokinon 12mm f2.0 lens. I also have a Fujifilm XF 27mm f/2.8 lens that I use for car shows and street photography. </p>

                    <h2>3D Printing</h2>
                    <p>(Picture coming soon) <br> I have been 3D Printing since 2014, starting with a Printrbot Simple wood 3D printer. 3D printing was my first venture into manufacturing and CAD design, starting out with Autodesk 123D and Sketchup, later moving onto Solidworks and Autodesk Inventor. In my High School I was primarily responsible for keeping the printer calibrated properly, and printing anything that was requested. I was also the lead Engineer for the FIRST Robotics team, where I would design any pulley systems, drivetrains, and adapters needed for competition on my personal printer, a Monoprice Maker Select 3. I have since moved onto a Creality Cr-10 which I have used extensively in ASU projects printing turbines, fasteners, and other pieces for projects. In my personal use, I like chasing detail in printing scultpures/artwork, developing micro-quadcopters, halloween costumes, phone mounts, and soon to be a fully 3D printed chassis that I'm designing for a R/C rally car project.  </p>

                    <h2>Audio</h2>
                    <p>I like audio equipment to discover new experiences in music. Through this I have discovered many different artists and genres that I enjoy ranging anywhere from Jazz, Classical, Symphonic Death Metal, J-pop, Finnish/Japanese Folk Music, Future-Funk, and much more. Currently my Triangle Borea BR02s are my absolute favorite piece of audio gear that I own. They were the first piece of equipment that could let me relive the experience I had when I first discovered Sleep Token in concert, and the first to let me forget about equipment, and become fully immersed in any music playing through them.  </p>
